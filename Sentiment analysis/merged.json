{"reviews":{"reviewer":{"displayName":"Angela Pressley"},"starRating":"TWO","comment":"Customer service was very nice. The prices were ok.  I haven't had good caribbean food  in a long time so I was excited about finding this restaurant. I was very disappointed with the food. I had goat soup and oxtails rice and peas. The goat soup was ok. It lacked goat meat and was more dumplings but the soup was very well seasoned. The oxtails rice and peas not very good. The rice was hard and it didn't have to authentic coconut milk seasoned taste. It had a burnt rice smell and taste. The oxtails were soft but not tasty.  I will be going to Golden Krust or another restaurant further down main street next time.","createTime":"2022-01-18T16:52:22.018400Z","updateTime":"2022-01-18T16:52:22.018400Z","name":"accounts\/113125786415732178818\/locations\/11630302524519852185\/reviews\/ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURtLUp2S1R3EAE"}}
